      "In my <span style='color: blue;'><strong>Monte Carlo Localization</strong></span> (particle filter localization) project with Cozmo Robot, I worked as a team with my partner, implementing a probabilistic algorithm using <span style='color: blue;'><strong>Python</strong></span> to enable the robot to determine its position within a given environment/arena. The algorithm uses a set of <span style='color: blue;'><strong>particles</strong></span> to represent possible <span style='color: blue;'><strong>positions</strong></span> of the robot. Each particle is weighted based on <span style='color: blue;'><strong>sensor measurements</strong></span> compared to a pre-defined map, allowing the robot to estimate its position with increasing accuracy over time. Main elements of the implementation included sensor data integration, particle weight calculation, resampling techniques, and efficient handling of localization updates to ensure real-time performance."

      "<span style='color: blue;'><strong>Sokoban Game</strong></span> is a classic puzzle video game in which the player pushes boxes or crates within a warehouse setting, trying to get them to designated storage locations. I implemented this using <span style='color: blue;'><strong>C++</strong></span> which included logic for player movements, box interactions, and collision detection, and also making use of <span style='color: blue;'><strong>SFML</strong></span> for rendering <span style='color: blue;'><strong>graphics</strong></span>. The Sokoban class manages the game state, player position, and level data, while methods like movePlayer and isWon handle game mechanics and victory conditions. The game employs C++ standard libraries and smart pointers for efficient data management and memory use."

      "<span style='color: blue;'><strong>Checkers</strong></span> is a game of two players played on a board. Each player in this game tries to eliminate all pieces belonging to his or her enemy and prevent those pieces from moving at all by utilizing their own pieces. I implemented this game using <span style='color: blue;'><strong>C++</strong></span> that can be played in a terminal with the necessary <span style='color: blue;'><strong>SFML</strong></span> and <span style='color: blue;'><strong>C++ libraries</strong></span>. I utilized <span style='color: blue;'><strong>object-oriented programming</strong></span> principles to manage game states, validate moves, and handle the promotion of pieces to kings. The game supports a graphical user interface using the SFML library, enhancing the user experience with interactive visuals and gameplay mechanics."

      "This <span style='color: blue;'><strong><a href='https://sudhir848.github.io/Scrabble-Game/' target='_blank'>one-line version</a></strong></span> of the Scrabble game is a streamlined implementation of the classic word game. This version focuses on delivering the core gameplay experience in a concise format, allowing players to form words from a given set of letters to score points based on the value of each letter. The game features a <span style='color: blue;'><strong>word validation system</strong></span>, a <span style='color: blue;'><strong>scoring mechanism</strong></span>, and a <span style='color: blue;'><strong>user-friendly interface</strong></span> for easy interaction. I designed this using <span style='color: blue;'><strong>HTML</strong></span>, <span style='color: blue;'><strong>CSS</strong></span>, <span style='color: blue;'><strong>JavaScript</strong></span>, and <span style='color: blue;'><strong>jQuery</strong></span>, combining these technologies to create a responsive and interactive web application. HTML structures the content, CSS provides the styling, JavaScript handles the game logic, and jQuery simplifies DOM manipulation and enhances the user experience."
