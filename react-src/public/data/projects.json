The algorithm uses a set of <span style='color: blue;'><strong>particles</strong></span> to represent possible <span style='color: blue;'><strong>positions</strong></span> of the robot. Each particle is weighted based on <span style='color: blue;'><strong>sensor measurements</strong></span> compared to a pre-defined map, allowing the robot to estimate its position with increasing accuracy over time. Main elements of the implementation included sensor data integration, particle weight calculation, resampling techniques, and efficient handling of localization updates to ensure real-time performance."
