The algorithm uses a set of <span style='color: blue;'><strong>particles</strong></span> to represent possible <span style='color: blue;'><strong>positions</strong></span> of the robot. Each particle is weighted based on <span style='color: blue;'><strong>sensor measurements</strong></span> compared to a pre-defined map, allowing the robot to estimate its position with increasing accuracy over time. Main elements of the implementation included sensor data integration, particle weight calculation, resampling techniques, and efficient handling of localization updates to ensure real-time performance."

The scanner is designed to analyze publicly accessible web applications and automatically identify common security weaknesses, including <span style='color: blue;'><strong>SQL Injection (SQLi)</strong></span>, <span style='color: blue;'><strong>Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)</strong></span>, <span style='color: blue;'><strong>missing or misconfigured security headers</strong></span>, <span style='color: blue;'><strong>insecure cookie attributes</strong></span>, <span style='color: blue;'><strong>SSL/TLS configuration issues</strong></span>, and basic <span style='color: blue;'><strong>network-level findings</strong></span> such as open ports and information leakage. The application follows a <span style='color: blue;'><strong>modular scanning architecture</strong></span>, where each vulnerability category is implemented as a separate Python module, allowing for clear separation of concerns and easier extensibility. The core controller orchestrates scans using <span style='color: blue;'><strong>multithreading</strong></span> so that multiple vulnerability checks can run concurrently, improving overall scan performance. Users can select between a <span style='color: blue;'><strong>basic</strong></span> or <span style='color: blue;'><strong>deep scan</strong></span> mode to control scan intensity and depth. Scan results are presented through a <span style='color: blue;'><strong>Flask-based web interface</strong></span>, where findings are grouped by category and severity. The tool also generates a downloadable <span style='color: blue;'><strong>PDF report</strong></span> that summarizes detected vulnerabilities and includes corresponding <span style='color: blue;'><strong>remediation guidance</strong></span>, making the scanner suitable for both academic use and introductory real-world security testing."
